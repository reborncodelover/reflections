Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Answer: We would always want to pull the changes from remote manually rather than Git automatically
	pull the new changes from remote. The primary reason is that you might have made changes in your

	everytime. Rather we would like to pull when we are ready.
