When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
Answer: I would create a remote repository when I want to start collabortaing with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Answer: We would always want to pull the changes from remote manually rather than Git automatically
	pull the new changes from remote. The primary reason is that you might have made changes in your 
	local repository and the same file might have been changed on remote. So, we would need to merge 
	everytime. Rather we would like to pull when we are ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
Answer: Forks made so that you can make changes without impacting the repository where you forked it from. 
	Forks are useful a) when you don't permission to make changes directly the repository or b) you want 
	to keep making changes (like adding features etc) on your own.
	Clone helps you to get a copy of the repository (i.e. a clone) from github to your own computer.
	Branches are labels of specific commits. Once a branch is created you can keep making additional 
	changes on the branches without impacting where you branched off (until you merge the branches again)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
Answer: Enables you to access the changes made by others in remote that have not yet been included in your branch.
	Basically, this helps to integrate the changes from local and remote branches during pull operation.
